# Day 01 – Getting Started with Python

On Day 1, I learned:
- What Python is
- How to take input from the user
- How to print output
- Writing my first real Python program (not hello world)

## Code
- intro_program.py → A simple program that takes user input and prints a personal intro

## Learning
Today was about understanding basics, not speed.
Consistency > Motivation.
